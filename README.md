# Tevo Flash

This is a modified fork of the stock firmware for Tevo Flash 3D Printer found at https://github.com/tevo3d/Tevo-Flash.

This modification was created to work around a faulty motherboard, where a faulty pin caused the heatbed to always register 136 degrees.  This modified firmware uses the heatbed thermister plugged into the E2 pin (the purple pin).
